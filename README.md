# IPL_Data_Project_Analysis

This project analyzes Indian Premier League (IPL) match and player data using Microsoft Excel.
The analysis explores team performance, scoring trends, top batsmen, wicket-takers, toss decisions, venue patterns, and season-wise insights — all built using Excel formulas, pivot tables, charts, and dashboards.

The objective of this project is to use Excel to clean, process, analyze, and visualize IPL data.
The goal is to answer key cricket analytics questions such as:

Which team has performed the best across seasons?

Who are the top batsmen and bowlers?

Does winning the toss influence the match outcome?

Which venues favor batting or bowling?

How do runs vary across seasons?

Which players are the most consistent?

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates how powerful Excel can be for sports analytics.
